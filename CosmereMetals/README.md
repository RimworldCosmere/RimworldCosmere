# ⚗️ Cosmere Metals

*A shared metals library for Cosmere-based mods in RimWorld.*

---

## 🌌 What's Included

- Adds/Replaces all **16 base metals** from Scadrial as *stuffable materials* with balanced stat modifiers.
- Also adds Nickel (for alloying), and Coal/Charcoal
- All new/replaced metals and materials have a fresh new texture
- Removes mine-able Steel. Now must come from alloying Coal/Charcoal with Iron 
- Introduces rare >!**Godmetals** like Atium and Lerasium!< — powerful and lore-rich, when each dependent mod is added
- Integrated into **world generation**, with custom ores appearing across biomes.
- Each metal includes:
    - Damage multipliers (sharp/blunt)
    - Armor and insulation stats
    - Beauty, market value, mass, and flammability
    - Proper *StuffCategory* support
- Designed to be used by other mods (e.g. Scadrial).
- No major gameplay changes, besides steel — *vanilla-friendly and modular*.

## 📦 Use & Compatibility
