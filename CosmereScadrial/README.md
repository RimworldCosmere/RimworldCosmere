# Cosmere - Scadrial

***This is very much an alpha, please be patient. File bug reports in GitHub or Discord***

*Adds the Metallic Arts — Allomancy, Feruchemy, and >!Hemalurgy!< — to RimWorld.*

---

## What's Included

- **Allomancy**
    - Includes every base metal and >!Godmetal!<, each granting unique powers
    - Mistings can burn a single metal — >!Coinshots, Soothers, Thugs, etc.!<
    - Mistborn can burn all metals (if you're lucky enough to have one…)
    - Full burn and flare systems with unique abilities, auras, and status effects
    - Multi-metal vials, targeted abilities, and environmental effects

- **Feruchemy - Coming Soon!**
    - Store and tap traits like strength, speed, health, or senses
    - Full Feruchemists can master the entire suite of metalminds
    - Custom storage mechanics and UI integration for charge tracking

- **>!Hemalurgy - Coming Soon!<**
    - >!Dark, dangerous, and very real. Use at your own moral peril. WIP but coming soon.!<

- **Genetics-Based Metalborn**
    - Allomantic and Feruchemical powers are inheritable via genes
    - Supports player reproduction, pawn generation, and custom xenotypes

- **Snapping**
    - Pawns can 'snap' under stress, unlocking latent Metalborn potential
    - Includes chance-based snaps during trauma or atmospheric events

- **New Traits, Thoughts, and Needs**
    - Investiture is gained by burning metals
    - Custom thoughts for burning, flaring, auras, and suppression
    - Reworked Skaa, Noble, and Terris xenotypes (based on heritage and genetics)

- **Scenario Support**
    - Pre- and Post-Catacendre scenarios
    - Choose whether Ruin & Preservation or Harmony govern your world
    - Xenotype restrictions, gene weighting, and thematic pawn randomization

---

## Use & Compatibility

- Requires Biotech
- Compatible with Ideology, Royalty, and Anomaly
- Designed for RimWorld 1.5 (1.6 coming soon!)
- Safe to add at game start
- Mid-save support is partial — best used in a new colony (you wont get all the metals)

---

## Tips

- Use the **Investiture tab** to track charges and status
- Right click to use Allomantic Abilities
- Ctrl-click to flare an ability
- Mistborn and Full Feruchemists are **extremely rare** by default
- >!Burning Lerasium can change everything...!<
