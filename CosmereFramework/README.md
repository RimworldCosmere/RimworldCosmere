# 🧱 Cosmere Framework

*Shared utility code for Cosmere-based RimWorld mods.*

## 🔧 What This Mod Does

This mod provides internal C# utility classes used by other Cosmere mods.  
It does **not** add any content, gameplay changes, or settings on its own.

If you’re seeing this listed as a requirement, it’s because another mod depends on it.

---

## 📦 Use & Compatibility

- No gameplay impact by itself
- Safe to add or remove at any time (unless required by another mod)
- Supports RimWorld 1.5 with Biotech, Ideology, Royalty, and Anomaly

---

## 🛠️ Part of the RimWorld: Cosmere Project

Required by mods such as:

- Cosmere - Scadrial *(Coming Soon)*
- Cosmere - Roshar *(WIP)*
- Cosmere - Nalthis *(WIP)*

---

## 🧪 For Modders

Feel free to use it as a dependency in your own Cosmere-compatible mods.
