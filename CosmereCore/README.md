##  What This Mod Does

This mod lays the groundwork for Investiture across the Cosmere. It introduces key mechanics and systems used by other
Cosmere mods.

Included features:

- **New StatDefs**
    - `MentalBreakAddFactor`: Modifies how likely a pawn is to suffer a mental break
    - `MentalBreakRemoveFactor`: Modifies how likely a pawn is to be calmed from one
    - `Cosmere_Time_Dilation_Factor`: Used mostly by Scadrial Bendalloy and Cadmium burners. Used to tweak a few things that don't natively have stats (Burn rate of metals for example)
    - `Cosmere_Investiture`: How much investiture a pawn has!

- **Investiture Need**  
  A unique pawn need used to power magical abilities across all Shardworlds

- **Investiture Research Project**  
  Unlocks access to investiture-related gameplay

- **Invested Trait**  
  Represents innate investiture, modeled after the Heightenings from Nalthis

- **Shard Selection System**  
  Adds a game component that allows players to configure which Shards are present in their world  
  (Used by mods like Scadrial, Roshar, Nalthis â€” each will auto-enable based on scenario)

## Use & Compatibility

- This is a *required core mod* for all other Cosmere expansions
- Safe to add at game start
- Requires Biotech (These mods all use too much of the gene and xenotype system to decouple)
- Compatible with RimWorld 1.6 + Biotech, Ideology, Royalty, and Anomaly

## For Modders
