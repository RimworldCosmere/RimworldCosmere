        <description>Compounding atium twists time inward. As the metal burns, the Allomancer feels their body accelerate through the years — skin loosens, joints stiffen, hair grays. Yet this sacrifice is not in vain. Every moment of age stored flows into the metalmind, building a reservoir of youth that can one day undo all decay. It is a dangerous alchemy: to grow old now, so you may steal your youth back later — stronger, faster, renewed.</description>
